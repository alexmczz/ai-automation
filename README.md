# Interactive CLI AI project

This project allows you to generate/executes bash scripts using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. It provides an interactive terminal interface where you can input a desired action, and the GPT model will generate a bash script based on the input.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary dependencies.
2. Run the `main.py` script.
3. Enter your desired action to generate a bash script.

## Credits

This project utilizes the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model for generating AI responses. I would like to give credit to OpenAI and its developers for creating this remarkable technology.

Please note that the current implementation relies on the GPT model as a temporary solution until my own custom AI model is complete. The AI responses generated during this temporary phase are powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.

## Future Plans

I am actively working on developing our own AI model to enhance the bash script generation process. Once my custom model is ready, it will replace the temporary usage of the GPT model. I am excited to bring more innovations and improvements to this project.

Your contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome as we continue to evolve and refine this project.

## Disclaimer

The AI responses generated by this project are based on patterns and information present in the training data used for the GPT-3.5 model. It is essential to exercise caution when using the generated bash scripts in a production environment. 
Always review and validate the output to ensure it meets your specific requirements.
